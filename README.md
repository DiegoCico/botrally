## Inspiration

The inspiration for BotRally came from the intersection of three powerful learning concepts:

- **Learning through play**: Making programming education engaging and fun through competitive racing
- **Visual programming accessibility**: Using Scratch-like blocks to make algorithm design approachable for beginners
- **Real-world application**: Teaching core computer science concepts (sensors, control systems, AI) through autonomous vehicle programming

We wanted to create a platform where students could learn fundamental programming concepts like conditional logic, sensor processing, and algorithm optimization while having the immediate satisfaction of watching their code come to life on a race track. The competitive element adds motivation and makes abstract programming concepts tangible.
